#  Hiring Process Analytics Project

This project simulates the role of a Data Analyst at a multinational company (like Google) tasked with evaluating and improving the hiring process. The analysis is performed entirely in **Microsoft Excel**, with a strong focus on **statistics**, **data cleaning**, and **visualization**.

##  Objective

To explore, clean, and analyze historical hiring data in order to draw insights that can help improve the hiring pipeline — such as gender balance, department distribution, position tiers, and salary trends.

##  Tech Stack

- **Microsoft Excel** (2022 or later)
- **Pivot Tables**, **Charts**, **Formulas** (e.g., AVERAGE, COUNTIF, IF, VLOOKUP)
- **Statistical Analysis**: Outlier detection, handling missing data, class intervals

##  Files Included

- `Hiring_Analytics_Report.pptx` – Final presentation summarizing analysis, charts, and insights
- `Hiring_Data.xlsx` – The Excel file with cleaned data, formulas, charts, and all task responses
- (Optional) `README.md` – Project overview and learning summary

##  Key Analysis Performed

- **Missing Value Handling**: Identified and cleaned missing or inconsistent entries
- **Outlier Detection**: Used statistical logic to handle outliers affecting salary distribution
- **Column Clubbing**: Grouped redundant columns to improve analytical clarity
- **Gender Distribution**: Calculated male vs female hiring ratio
- **Salary Summary**: Found average salary, created salary class intervals
- **Department-wise Hiring**: Created pie/bar charts showing employee distribution
- **Position Tier Analysis**: Visualized hiring across junior/mid/senior-level positions

##  Insights

- Majority of hires were in mid-level positions, with noticeable skew in department hiring
- Average salary was consistent, but outliers caused wide salary range
- Gender distribution was moderately balanced, but improvements could be made in leadership roles

##  Final Result

All findings are presented in the report with Excel charts, statistical calculations, and actionable insights.
